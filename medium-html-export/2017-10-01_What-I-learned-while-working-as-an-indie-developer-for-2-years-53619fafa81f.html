With that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">posture</strong>, I strived to make my communication with clients and prospects more concise, pragmatic, and uncompromising. I do believe that I‚Äôm a good software engineer. But, in retrospect, I was mostly showing that I was a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cold, unreassuring person</strong>. Besides the risk of earning a bad reputation, adopting this posture can lead to picking opportunities for the wrong reasons. For instance, letting exciting missions go, in favour to missions proposed by clients that tolerated to play my game. It happened to me once: I accepted a mission that wasn‚Äôt really a good fit with my interests, just to stick to my values and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">to not lose face</strong>.

By giving, I mean: to listen, to give advice, to suggest, to show, to share, or more generally, to help people. Besides making the world a better place, giving is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">great way to demonstrate</strong> one‚Äôs quality, skills, and benevolence. The fact that I‚Äôm writing this article and publishing it publicly is a good example. The idea of publishing useful information is also the basis of ‚Äú<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">content marketing</strong>.‚Äù</p><figure name="5f99" id="5f99" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"></figure><p name="c484" id="c484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Anecdote:</strong> A few months after having given strategic advice to young startup creators, I had the surprise of receiving an email from one of them. He was telling me that he had launched his startup, that it was developing well, and that my advice had helped him a lot in that process. I was so <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">happy</strong> to read from him, and to read that my advice was useful, that it cleared every trace of guilt I was feeling for not having found a way to charge him and/or other creators I had met at that time. In retrospect, I had just offered him some advice (that was obvious for me), while drinking a few beers. But, for him, this meeting apparently had a lot of value. Thinking about it, I‚Äôm glad I indirectly <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">contributed</strong> to the birth of a new startup, and I‚Äôm flattered that its creator remembers and values the help I gave him.</p><blockquote name="d328" id="d328" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Pro tip: </strong>It works the other way round, as well: people like to be helpful.

Justin often insists on the idea that, in order to make dollars, a product must be designed to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">give ‚Äúsuper powers‚Äù</strong> to its users. For instance: in order to reduce carbon footprint, Telsa do not market their cars as ecological cars. Rather, they sell ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù, high performance cars. Cars that people <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">desire to buy</strong>. Buyers are not looking for an ecological car, they want to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">be part of a minority</strong> of drivers who live on the edge of technology. This explains why Tesla integrated the ‚ÄúInsane Mode,‚Äù making their cars accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3 seconds.</p><p name="146f" id="146f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It‚Äôs become clear that my first product does not give super powers to anybody.

I asked them what would make my product really indispensable for their everyday use, and how much they would be happy to pay for this. The results convinced me to launch a crowdfunding campaign to develop a second version of my product, based on the most popular feature requests. At the end, only three users agreed to participate, and the campaign failed. My advice: survey results are overly optimistic. The decision is not fully made until the user sent their payment.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="655c" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="14fb" id="14fb" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Marketing: ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù is not a¬†target.</h3><p name="ea0f" id="ea0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Too many startups hope for press coverage on Techcrunch or spam their contacts to get more <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">votes on ProductHunt</strong>.

Yes, targeting a ‚Äúniche‚Äù means having fewer potential users.

Bummer!</p><p name="a676" id="a676" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It‚Äôs back from the trip at the end of my entrepreneurial period that I took the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">biggest risk of the last 18 months</strong>: I accepted to hold an 8-hour workshop in a school I had never taught at, with just a 24-hour notice! Why was this <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">risky</strong>? I had never physically given a course about ‚ÄúLean Management‚Äù before, and I had got no course material to rely on. Over the last 18 months, this experience ended up being one of the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">most exciting and rewarding </strong>ones!</p><blockquote name="fe5e" id="fe5e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Take-away</strong>: It‚Äôs important to keep reflecting, learn and be curious, but it‚Äôs even more important to not wait ‚Äú<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">to be ready</strong>‚Äù before going ahead with an exciting project. Challenges allow us to push our limits forward, or at least, to be able to discover what are our real limits.
