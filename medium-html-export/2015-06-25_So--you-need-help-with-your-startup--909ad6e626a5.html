I’m flattered by their trust in my skills for helping them, and grateful to my friends who recommended me to potential clients for the same reasons. And, as you know, I am committed to helping people create start-up companies, because I believe that’s the best way for society to evolve. But, if I want this mission of mine to scale enough to match the demand, we need to optimize this meet-and-pitch process.</p><p name="130e" id="130e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my previous article, I explained that <a href="https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854" data-href="https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">I avoid phone calls</a>. I had to write that because most people who wanted to reach me for start-up advice were trying to call my cell phone first. (Some of them used to ask for my résumé, just to find my phone number!) That was not optimal use of time, for I, and for them. Now that you know that email is the best way to reach me, we can discuss the best way to introduce your business and your needs by email.</p><h4 name="b05f" id="b05f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">1 — What are you striving to achieve, and why?</h4><p name="55bb" id="55bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you’re an entrepreneur, the first things I would like to know about you are:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="40ec" id="40ec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">what problem are you trying to solve? why?</li><li name="2bbc" id="2bbc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">who are you, and what makes you a great candidate for solving this problem? (e.g. it could be your experience, your wealth, your contacts… you tell me!)</li><li name="174a" id="174a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">how would you pitch your project so that it fits in a tweet? (i.e. 140 characters max)</li></ul><p name="0af5" id="0af5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Hopefully, your answers will tell me a lot about your values, your motivation, your assets, and the relevance of your project. It will help me build confidence in your project, and in you as its leader. It will motivate me to help you.</p><p name="d3b5" id="d3b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 140-character pitch helps me understand your main value proposition, which may help later to decide what to include (or not) in a MVP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a>).</p><h4 name="3f83" id="3f83" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">2 — What did you try and failed to do?</h4><p name="097d" id="097d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The second thing that is very important to measure is your degree of sweat (or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hustling</em>, as <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/" data-href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gary Vee</a> would say) you’ve put into your business, and the spectrum of roles you have been able to play in it. Basically, it helps me quantify one of the personal assets I value most: merit. The best way to measure this is: you tell me what you did, or tried to do.</p><p name="fc95" id="fc95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This includes what other people did (or tried to do) for your project: your co-founder(s), collaborators, potential clients, agencies, friends, and family. The more people involved in your project, the more I will trust your ability to convince people to take a part in your business.</p><figure name="3277" id="3277" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 649px; max-height: 427px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 65.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_O26STDDfaIXeqdu8opz5A.jpeg" data-width="649" data-height="427" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_O26STDDfaIXeqdu8opz5A.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">One of the most famous example of pretotype: Palm Digital Assistant</figcaption></figure><p name="a318" id="a318" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In most cases, young entrepreneurs tell me that they studied their market, sketched a few screens of their future mobile app on paper, wrote some powerpoint slides, applied to several start-up incubators… That’s a good start, but in that case (and if it applies), I would urge you to read <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2744065080/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1642&amp;creative=6746&amp;creativeASIN=2744065080&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adrienjolycom-21&amp;linkId=E5Z6FN6ZUIG3COPC" data-href="http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2744065080/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1642&amp;creative=6746&amp;creativeASIN=2744065080&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adrienjolycom-21&amp;linkId=E5Z6FN6ZUIG3COPC" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eric Ries’ book “The Lean Startup”</a> (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">yes, I’ll get a commission if you buy it from here; thank you!</em>), and try to solve the problem that your project aims to solve, manually. By hand. Without needing any programming. Just using what you are able to do: send emails, call potential clients and partners on the phone, go out and meet them, etc… That’s called <a href="http://www.pretotyping.org/uploads/1/4/0/9/14099067/pretotype_it_2nd_pretotype_edition-2.pdf" data-href="http://www.pretotyping.org/uploads/1/4/0/9/14099067/pretotype_it_2nd_pretotype_edition-2.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pretotyping</a>.

It should hopefully be the natural continuation of what you did, up to now. And I guess that, if you’re seeking help, it’s because reaching that milestone requires something that you don’t have. Or maybe is it because you have no idea how to reach this kind of milestone? In the former case, I will need you to list what you already have, and the missing parts that you need.</p><p name="a3b7" id="a3b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you think that what you need is a co-founder, a technical associate, a CTO, please explain why. What do you expect from that person, and why this person would love to work with you. (e.g. money, fame, or maybe because you’re the best co-founder he could expect for executing this project?) Also, what did you already try in order to find one, and what went wrong. If like most entrepreneurs I meet, you’re looking for a CTO, please tell me why hiring a freelance developer (or agency) would not suffice, at least for achieving your next milestone?</p><figure name="f8f7" id="f8f7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 490px; max-height: 409px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 83.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ETbJwcfa0L6axG9GCZ95eA.jpeg" data-width="490" data-height="409" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ETbJwcfa0L6axG9GCZ95eA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">An illustration of how startup entrepreneurs sometimes look like when they come to me.</figcaption></figure><p name="6bdf" id="6bdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although it’s not necessary, I would also love to know what makes you think that I’m the right person to help you.
