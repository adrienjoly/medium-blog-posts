> ‚ÑπÔ∏èÔ∏è This article is a quick translation of ‚Äú[D√©velopper et vendre ses propres produits: mon retour d‚Äôexp√©rience](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/d%C3%A9velopper-et-vendre-ses-propres-produits-mon-retour-dexp%C3%A9rience-6a38cca54751)‚Äù (üá´üá∑). Sorry for the grammar mistakes, literal translations, and thank you for your understanding!

**Mid-September, 2017**. I have just enough money to survive 3 months without a salary. It‚Äôs now time to get back to financial stability. \*

For the last 12 months, I‚Äôve been trading 1‚Äì2 days per week to earn a teaching salary. Besides that, I was free to do what I wanted!

What did I do during that time? What are my results? **This is my story.**

*\* If you‚Äôre curious about accounting: I‚Äôve been living off 2500‚Ç¨/month since last summer. Including a 1000‚Ç¨/month mortgage, and 600‚Ç¨ of taxes. I was earning 1300‚Ç¨/month from my teaching job, and used my savings from previous jobs.*

### 1\. Six months to make some¬†income

In March 2016, I met a collective of young freelancers and digital nomads called Mangrove. They motivated me to spend more time to develop my own projects.

[**From immediate profitability to pleasure, a shift of priorities**  
*How 1 year and 4 months of freedom made me more self-aware and confident: a journey in 5 venn diagrams.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/from-immediate-profitability-to-pleasure-a-shift-of-priorities-3f767253084e "https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/from-immediate-profitability-to-pleasure-a-shift-of-priorities-3f767253084e")[](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/from-immediate-profitability-to-pleasure-a-shift-of-priorities-3f767253084e)

I had also heard of a website on which several developers were sharing their story of how they made a living by developing their own products: [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com). I was excited!

[**Learn from the entrepreneurs behind profitable online businesses**  
*Hundreds of interviews with successful founders who share the revenue numbers behind their businesses and explain how‚Ä¶*indiehackers.com](https://indiehackers.com "https://indiehackers.com")[](https://indiehackers.com)

I could already see myself coding all day on my own ideas, become my own boss, and earn enough to live an enjoyable life. I couldn‚Äôt wait to start! üòã

Summer 2016. I decided to say good bye to my clients, and sail my own boat: **develop and live off my own ideas**!

So I published my long list of ideas online, to see which of them was most likely to succeed, based on interest feedback. Then [I committed to the goal](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/getting-paid-directly-by-users-to-craft-software-for-them-1a8ef5e1a73) of making 100‚Ç¨ per month of revenue before spring, and [adopted a strict productivity routine](https://byrslf.co/work-on-12-projects-without-burning-out-f5bec50dafdb). I was excited by my ideas, confident of my skills, and determined to succeed! üí™

October 2016. [I launched my first product](https://medium.com/pitchcard/from-95-ideas-to-1-winning-product-a84ddd54df49): **Next Step for Trello**. A browser extension to track progress more efficiently on my Trello boards. It was a great start: I had convinced 3300 users in 2 months, without too much effort!

I was getting a lot of positive feedback from users, so I asked them what **improvements** would make my product really essential. Based on their answers, I launched [two crowdfunding campaigns](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/will-you-be-my-patron-ad89111f316a):

*   a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of **Next Step for Trello v2.0**, with the most requested features;
*   and a Patreon campaign, for users and friends who were more interested in **donating** in return for exclusive rewards related to the development process of my craft.

In order to boost donations, I streamed several live sessions during which I was developing features and replying to questions, on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/adrienjoly) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjPady24Mws&list=PLmzn1C-VN6G7FLdUJM3G82cG-Q69xJ2AY).

Despite the promising feedback users had given me, those two crowdfunding campaigns ended up **failing**. üèú

### 2\. An opportunity for productivity workshops

Disappointed by this first failure, I decided to try a different direction. Seeing that I was working efficiently and [had been writing a lot about productivity](http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips), several friends were very interested in some productivity advice from me. So I decided to propose a **productivity workshop**.

[**Adrien's Productivity Tips by Adrien Joly**  
*Every week, I send you free bite-sized tips on how to improve your time management, work and communication skills‚Ä¶*tinyletter.com](http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips "http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips")[](http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips)

After planning my workshop ‚Äú*Improve your productivity: learn how to procrastinate less*‚Äù for January 2017, we ended up **canceling it**, due to a low number of sign-ups.

Fortunately, I was able to convince one of the registered participants to convert her ticket to 2 hours of personal **coaching**.

\=> **First income**: 100‚Ç¨ earned in February 2017, finally! üôå

That being said, I quickly realised that I was **not that motivated** about teaching or coaching about that topic. So I decided to move on to another project.

Besides, during her presentation in Paris, [Poornima Vijayashanker](https://medium.com/u/ebd37a9be319) [made me realise](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/current-experiments-turning-what-i-%EF%B8%8F-doing-into-8b8c1b34b66f) that, like many developers, I had some **difficulty to ask people to pay** for my software.

At that point, it also became clear that I had a lot to learn about **marketing**. Especially at the era of information overload we‚Äôre living in.

* * *

### 3\. Edtech and collaborative projects

After accepting that Next Step for Trello was not going to be a financial success, and that I was not motivated enough to teach about productivity, I decided to explore **other possibilities**:

*   monetise the **student evaluation software** I had been developing for 1.5 years, to help me cope with grading the code of my students;
*   and **partner up** with a few talented friends to develop the next products.

So I produced and **published several videos** to promote my educational tools, while getting started on two collaborative projects:

*   ‚Äú**New Day**‚Äù, a task management tool integrated into Google Chrome;
*   and ‚Äú**Clear**‚Äù, an application to enable discussions on customer forms.

My teammates and I were also working on other projects during that period, so we decided to spend just one day per week on each project. We also set a 2-months deadline.

Two months later, we gave our products for user testing and were **disappointed by their results**. So we decided to quit both projects.

My analysis is that we were lacking **proper leadership** and role distribution, especially for critical product decisions. I also think that spending just **one day per week was not enough** to cover for the communication overhead.

Simultaneously, I was discovering the art of **marketing and client prospection** on my Edtech project, thanks to [Justin Jackson](https://medium.com/u/a02dd1574d08), [Sean McCabe](https://medium.com/u/2e5037d50682), and [Clifford Oravec](https://medium.com/u/55e9fd9a459). I had set a goal of convincing 3 teachers to try my software in their classroom, out of a list of 100 leads I had written down. At the end, I did reach that goal after contacting 67 leads. But no trials happened yet. Wait and see!

### 4\. Taking a step¬†back

In April 2017, I understood why we say that entrepreneurs **feel lonely**. Starting a business turns heaps of time and energy into failure and self-doubt. But the worst is to be seen as an alien by your family and friends. Most of them did not understand what I was doing, and did not dare to talk to me about it. And, as I was spending most of my time building my business, we did not have much else to talk about‚Ä¶

[**Moving on, from side-projects to real products**  
*Failing attempts has been fun. Now let‚Äôs find the holy market fit!*hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/moving-on-from-side-projects-to-real-products-f6cc24f556ff "https://hackernoon.com/moving-on-from-side-projects-to-real-products-f6cc24f556ff")[](https://hackernoon.com/moving-on-from-side-projects-to-real-products-f6cc24f556ff)

I also understood that I was spreading energy into **too many projects at the same time**. I had to focus more. To get rid of some of them. So I made a [SWOT analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) (***s****trengths,* ***w****eaknesses,* ***o****pportunities,* ***t****hreats*) for each project, to help me decide wisely.

Last but not least, [I realised](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/im-not-the-10x-developer-i-thought-i-was-acad63d059a4) that I had mistakenly thought I was a ‚Äú10x developer.‚Äù While, really, **I was acting** like one, just to cover my insecurities. My lack of self-confidence and trust towards others.

[**I‚Äôm not the 10x developer I thought I was.**  
*This is the story that I‚Äôve been telling myself, and why I made up that lie.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/im-not-the-10x-developer-i-thought-i-was-acad63d059a4 "https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/im-not-the-10x-developer-i-thought-i-was-acad63d059a4")[](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/im-not-the-10x-developer-i-thought-i-was-acad63d059a4)

### 5\. Letting go and¬†closure

In June 2017, I knew that my savings were almost over, and that my chances of making an income were at their lowest. I knew that I was reaching **the end of this adventure**.

So I decided to follow 3 directives:

*   Leave my projects in a functional and clean state;
*   publish quality content to show what I had done during the 12 months;
*   and invest time on the **most exciting projects**, rather than the ones that I thought were more likely to monetise.

I ended up publishing:

*   an informal report about what I learned during my first 2 years as a teacher;
*   a concise video to demonstrate my student evaluation software,
*   a landing page and mailing list for teachers who are interested in trying it;
*   and I launched a crowdfunding campaign to sustain **Openwhyd**. The least viable but coolest project to work on.

[**üïµ Steady progress and good surprises!**  
medium.com](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/steady-progress-and-good-surprises-a65efe4e02fc "https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/steady-progress-and-good-surprises-a65efe4e02fc")[](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/steady-progress-and-good-surprises-a65efe4e02fc)

Against all odds, **Openwhyd‚Äôs crowdfunding campaign was a success**! We raised enough to pay for 4 months of hosting, and it motivated volunteers to contribute to the project!

In July 2017, I decided to participate in the Atlassian Codegeist contest, by submitting a Power-up for Trello: ‚Äú**Comment Editor by AJ**.‚Äù I did not win the contest, but Trello did integrate my Power-up. So I take it as a validation of my quality as extension developer. ‚ÄúNext Step for Trello‚Äù was also an extension, but it was not integrated into Trello. Feeling **accomplished**!

[**üöÄ News: Power-up on its way to Trello, and WIP community!**  
*Over the last 10 days, I was supposed to chill with my family in the south of France. I did. Also, I did not! üôÉ*hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/power-up-on-its-way-to-trello-and-wip-community-5af44320badc "https://hackernoon.com/power-up-on-its-way-to-trello-and-wip-community-5af44320badc")[](https://hackernoon.com/power-up-on-its-way-to-trello-and-wip-community-5af44320badc)

On a side note, I opened a community of product developers called ‚Äú[Work In Progress](https://spectrum.chat/wip),‚Äù in order to help and praise developers like me who are developing their own ideas.

And, before leaving to the USA, I rediscovered the joy of soldering!

### Conclusion

I hope that this article will help my family and friends **better understand** what I‚Äôve been up to since last summer. My intent is also to ease the feelings of other developers who, like me, did not succeed as [indie hackers](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/indie-hackers). **That‚Äôs ok**!

I may write a **second article** to share a few actionnable tips for those who would like to try becoming an indie hacker too. Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested. **\[EDIT\] I linked it below:**
