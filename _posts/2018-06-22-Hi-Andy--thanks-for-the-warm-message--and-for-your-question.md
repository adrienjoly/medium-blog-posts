Hi Andy, thanks for the warm message, and for your questionÂ !

Yes, I would still do it, even if I knew that the outcomes were gonna be the same.

That being said, if I had to do it again, I am now more informed about how to market products, and I would think about marketing (and particularly defining my target persona clearly, and adapting my messaging and communication channels towards that audience) before developing the product. And I would probably work on fewer products at the same time, also.
