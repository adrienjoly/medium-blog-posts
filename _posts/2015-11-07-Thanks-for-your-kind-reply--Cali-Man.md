Thanks for your kind reply, Cali Man!

Some may think that we become boring, as we get older. To me, we grow up towards knowing who we are, what we want, and not giving a fuck about what others think about that.

On the other hand, I get your point, but I think it may not be a bad thing for you to try enjoying things in Berkeley, by seeing it with a curious and open mind for a few weeks or months. See what it may have to offer that you may not have expected. After that, if you still don’t feel happy there, you will be 100% sure that moving to another place will be the right choice for you, and you won’t regret anything because you would had tried to enjoy Berkeley.

Cheers!
