Thanks for your reply, Thibauld!

I did consider it. I felt that OpenCollective was good for open-source projects who want to gather funds in order to cover costs, and share the amount of these costs transparently to their sponsors.

In my case, I don’t have any costs to cover related to my software yet. My only costs are to pay the bills of my personal life. And, while I don’t mind sharing information about my personal budget, I don’t think that it would be compatible with the values/spirit of OpenCollective.

Don’t hesitate to tell me if you think I’m wrong on this.
