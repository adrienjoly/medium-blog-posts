Dear music lovers,

Sorry for not having been active on [the development of Openwhyd](https://github.com/orgs/openwhyd/projects/1) lately, Iâ€™ve been very busy with [my new work](https://discourse.algolia.com/t/welcome-please-introduce-yourself/36/122?u=adrien.joly) and wanted to relax more during weekends.

Iâ€™m happy to see that Openwhyd usage stats remains steady despite the fact that I [disabled the background playback of tracks](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#-why-should-i-download-openwhyd-to-play-music-in-the-background) from the website. âœŠ

After having maintained Openwhyd for almost 6 years (since [its startup product phase](https://medium.com/openwhyd/music-amongst-other-topics-a4f41657d6d) to [its evolution to an open-source project](https://medium.com/openwhyd/handing-back-the-keys-to-users-the-openwhyd-music-curation-platform-case-3d26fa17a2f2)), I took a step back and decided to reduce my involvement to a bare minimum:

1.  to keep the server running,
2.  ensure user data privacy and safety (weekly backups),
3.  and help developers improve it.

This means that **I will not contribute code to Openwhyd anymore.**

From now on, if you want bugs to be fixed and/or features to be added to Openwhyd, the best you can expect from me is to **help you do it**. (You or a developer friend of yours.)

If you want to get involved in the development of Openwhyd, please [read our FAQ](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#id-love-to-contribute-to-openwhyd-how-can-i-help), then mention @adrienjoly on any Github issue youâ€™d like to contribute to, or send an email to contact@openwhyd.org. Iâ€™ll do my best to help! (Beginners are welcome too!)

I hope that youâ€™ll understand my decision, and that new maintainers will be interested in keeping our product and community of music lovers alive! ðŸ”¥

### **Have a great weekend, and never stopÂ jamming!**
