For years, I‚Äòve believed that I was a great developer because I was **more efficient than others**. I knew what shortcuts to take, how to give precise time estimations, and deliver on time, almost every time.

I was proud to ship and display dozens of diverse side-projects on my website. I ranted about communication inefficiencies on Medium. And, most dramatically, I accepted several freelance gigs based on how the client agreed to communicate with me, rather than on my motivation to work on their project.

[**Why I don‚Äôt answer most phone calls**  
*I wrote this article because many people don‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt pick up their phone calls, and why I love emails‚Ä¶*byrslf.co](https://byrslf.co/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854 "https://byrslf.co/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854")[](https://byrslf.co/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854)

> Today, I realise that this belief of being an efficient developer is not only pretentious, it‚Äôs an illusion I‚Äôve been hiding behind for¬†years.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I definitely **love to develop software products**. And my many years of experience do bring a lot of value.

I also love to define and sustain processes that allow people to work together **efficiently**, regardless of their location, their level of skill and experience, and the number of mistakes they make. (e.g. Agile / Lean methodologies)

Today, while replying to the teammate of a 2-month project, I came to the idea that, maybe, **I had been lying to myself for years**.

<figcaption>‚Äúno timeline in mind‚Äù&nbsp;üòá</figcaption>

Yes, I had just said ‚Äú**no timeline in mind**.‚Äù

The fact of replying this phrase may seem unimpressive to you. But those who know me well would be surprised to see me **letting go** like this.

I‚Äôm still feeling pumped about that experiment I‚Äôm working on, and confident that it can bring a lot of value. But surprisingly, this time, I don‚Äôt care about how much time it‚Äôs gonna take. **I‚Äôm going without an agenda.**

This time, I don‚Äôt care about what my teammate will think of my efficiency as a developer. I‚Äôm just gonna do it, enjoy doing it, and see where it leads us.

I think that, for years, I‚Äôve **convinced myself** that I was an ‚Äúefficient / no-bullshit developer‚Äù (a.k.a the ‚Äú10x developer‚Äù). Not because I am!

> I have used this story as a plausible excuse to not deal with my insecurities.

> *The fear of being trapped in the ‚Äúscope creep‚Äù loop of a never-ending project, spending hours* ***talking*** *on the phone or in meeting rooms instead of coding the project.*

> *Not feeling* ***self-confident*** *enough to take important decisions and risks.*

> *And having a hard time* ***trusting*** *others, and believe in their* ***good intentions****.*

So I was displaying myself in a **cold posture** to clients and teammates: ‚Äú*Send me the most concise and exhaustive brief you can do. Then shut up, let me ship it fast, and please don‚Äôt forget to tell me that I did great.*‚Äù

While this promise may sound compelling for clients, it is also not the best way to create a quality relationship. And definitely not a good way to create valuable products.

* * *

Software products and their development process are made of **uncertainty**. And, yes, working on something uncertain requires us, humans, to communicate, take decisions, and thus, **spend time** doing that, instead of actually writing code.

And, yes, these discussions can be irritating or frustrating sometimes. But some of them are necessary and important.

If I‚Äôm **running away** from communication, I don‚Äôt think anymore that it‚Äôs my clients/colleagues‚Äô fault.

> It‚Äôs my¬†fault.

If I want to keep coding on exciting projects, I need to stop excluding people that will get me out of my comfort zone. I should rather be **more specific** about what projects and domains excite me, and find the sweet spot between being **open** to suggestions, and **decisive** on what I think is **right**.

If I want to craft and ship great products, I need to fight my insecurities and become a better communicator, a better teammate, **a better human**.
