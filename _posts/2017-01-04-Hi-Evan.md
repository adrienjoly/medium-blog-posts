Hi Evan,

Congratulations for your work on Vue.js (I tried it and love it!), and for the deserved success of your Patreon campaign! You’re one of the rare developers that I’ve found who are able to make a living out of crafting free software that is not in the “adult entertainment” category! (as explained [here](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/getting-paid-directly-by-users-to-craft-software-for-them-1a8ef5e1a73#.kd1bsqlbs))! 🔥

I’d love to ask you a few questions about the story of Vue.js and how developing this library changed your life! I’m really interested in your story, because I’m pursuing a similar path. Would you accept an interview, by any chance?

Hope to read from you soon! In the mean time, I wish you an awesome year 2017! 🎉

Adrien
