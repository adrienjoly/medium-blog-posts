Hi Tobias,

I believe that the system you’re mentioning is very close to the one I describe in my article. They are both based on GTD concepts.

I love Trello and use it everyday for team work, but Wunderlist earns my preference for personal task management because I have not needed a bird’s eye view on all my tasks (i.e. the “visual” aspect that Tim Maurer likes). Also, I find that the ability to see the tasks of all your lists on one screen is distracting. But again, this is just my personal opinion.

I’m glad that you found your system of preference! Thank you for sharing!
