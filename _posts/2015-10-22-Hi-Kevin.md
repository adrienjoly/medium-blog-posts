Hi Kevin,

Thank you so much for sharing your point of view. I guess that it’s even harder for a sales person to not like phone calls, than for software engineers like me. I really believe that your approach of researching about your prospects in order to communicate efficiently with them is the best, even though it takes more energy and time. I would love to read if the success rate you get is worth that effort in the long run!

I wish you the best, thanks again for your response!

Adrien
