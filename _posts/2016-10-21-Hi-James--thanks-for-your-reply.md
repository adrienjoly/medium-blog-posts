Hi James, thanks for your reply!

Firstly, congrats for the 5000 stars on Github, and for at least making some revenue out of your project! You’re far ahead from me! ^^

Could it be that Patreon is not a good platform for your users? E.g. if your users are businesses, they would probably be less reluctant in paying one-shot for a license, or paying a subscription from your professional website. (i.e. for image, legal, and accounting reasons, I guess) Whereas Patreon seems a great fit for non-business consumers. (=> great for B2C products)

Have you tried other ways to monetise your development?

I’d love to talk with you some day! Let me know if you’d be interested!
