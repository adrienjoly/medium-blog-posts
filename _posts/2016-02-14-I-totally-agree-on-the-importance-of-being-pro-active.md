I totally agree on the importance of being pro-active!

Nevertheless, I’m not sure that it’s always a good idea to spend a lot of effort improving on “things I’m not good at”.

On that subject, I follow [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4)’s advice:

> “ Whether you’re 9 or 90, stop trying to fix the things you’re bad at, and focus on the things you’re good at. ”

E.g. I don’t care about how to cook better, or do business accounting. I prefer someone else to do that for me, in exchange for money, or something else that I can do (and enjoy doing) for them.

That being said, I do spend some time improving on weak skills, but I carefully choose those that will help me succeed in my endeavours.

A few examples:

*   I’m learning how to draw/doodle — to explain and collaborate on my ideas more efficiently;
*   I’ve learned how to use machine learning methods and tools — because I want to be able to build recommender systems in the software I build;
*   I’m learning how to deal with management of my shared property, with difficult part owners (*copropriétaires*) — because it makes me improve on active listening, empathy and negotiation skills (also useful for my freelance career).

Cheers!
