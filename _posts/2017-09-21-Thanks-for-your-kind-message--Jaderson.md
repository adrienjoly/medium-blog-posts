Thanks for your kind message, Jaderson!

I think that I’m very lucky to have been able to afford that 12-month experience! It’s awesome to be able to invest that much time for professional exploration and experimentation.

I definitely learnt HEAPS from this, and wrote this article to share a little bit back to the community of developers who are thinking of doing something similar.

Have a good one, Jaderson. And don’t hesitate if you have any other question!
