My productivity workflow has changed quite dramatically over the last 10 months (cf “[How I get things done](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/how-i-get-things-done-1509e9b6deaa#.pr373fogg)”, and “[My workflow + tools I use daily](http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips/letters/productivity-tips-13-my-workflow-tools-i-use-daily)”). I realized that a few days ago, while [answering a productivity question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-task-management-To-Do-Reminder-tools/answer/Adrien-Joly), and thought that I should write about it, and share some tips.

### 1\. Vision: Define your objective and projects

One month ago, I set up:

*   a 13-week objective in my [self-journal](https://bestself.co/products/self-journal);
*   a list of projects I wanted to invest my time on during these 13 weeks.

My 13-week roadmap looks like that:

I decided to open a living [Trello](http://trello.com) board, and create one card per project.

It currently looks like this:

<figcaption>The 12 projects I’m currently working on, as cards in a Trello&nbsp;board</figcaption>

This list of projects includes:

*   **Main/routine projects**: my teaching, the MOOC I’m going to publish, my quest of making a living out of the software I craft, and my music band.
*   **Development projects**: side-projects I’m actively developing, and personal development activities (e.g. things to read, and to learn)
*   **Projects to maintain**: secondary side-projects that are working, but that I like to regularly invest time on, for various reasons.

### 2\. Strategy: Split your projects into steps

In each project card, I defined a checklist of small steps (i.e. tasks that take less than a day to be done) to be done in order to achieve that project.

Sometimes, some of the steps are too big to be done in one day, but it’s ok, as long the first steps of the list are small. It’s still possible to re-split large steps into smaller ones later on.

I also took some time writing a description for each project card:

*   what is the goal of that project / why I’m willing to work on it;
*   what does this project consists of; (e.g. use cases, features…)
*   where are the resources linked to that project. (i.e. hyperlinks to Github repositories, Google Documents, shared directories, etc…)

That’s how one of my project’s card looks like:

### 3\. Tactics: Schedule tasks weekly

Even Sunday evening, I reflect on the past week:

*   how much time I invested on each project;
*   what achievements brought me closer to my objective;
*   what changes I’m willing to make in my workflow.

Then, I decide what’s for next week:

*   how much time I’m willing to invest on each project;
*   sort tasks, based on their importance, and deadlines;
*   schedule these tasks on my calendar. (usually ~3 tasks per day)

For this, I mainly use my paper journal.

I also use Google Calendar and [Plan](http://getplan.co) for scheduling, and my Trello board to see what are the next steps of each project.

That’s how my Trello board looks when I’m scheduling my tasks of the week:

I built [Next Step for Trello](http://adrienjoly.com/chrome-next-step-for-trello/) in order to see those steps directly from the board view, saving me precious minutes of opening and closing cards.

### 4\. Execution: Daily focus, progress & tracking

Every week day, in the morning:

*   When I wake up (usually around 8.30am), I write down what I remember from my dreams;
*   I think of people and things I’m grateful about, and write that down;
*   I put my 13-week objective back to mind, by re-writing it;
*   I read the list of tasks I scheduled for the day;
*   I do a quick daily physical exercise, then let my mind wander in the shower;
*   I share breakfast with my girlfriend;
*   Then I follow my schedule. (usually around 9.30am)

This is how a typical weekly schedule looks like:

While I’m working on a project:

*   Except when needed, I shut down every source of distraction and/or interruption: “do not disturb” mode on phone and laptop (i.e. disable notifications), close email inbox and IM/chat apps, play music in my earphones… Everything that can help me focus for the required time.
*   I keep the Trello card of that project open, so that I can write notes in it while I’m working on it.
*   I try to keep less than 10 browser tabs opened at all times.
*   When necessary, I update my calendar/schedule based on the time I actually spent on each task. Sometimes, I even un-schedule some of my tasks, but I try to not do that too often.

This is how the history of a project card looks like:

Whenever an idea of task comes to my mind, I get rid of it immediately by typing it as a reminder in Google Inbox:

<figcaption>Getting rid of a distracting idea, by typing it in Google&nbsp;Inbox.</figcaption>

Following the Inbox Zero technique, Google Inbox has helped me a lot to regularly empty my inbox.

If an email or reminder takes less than 2 minutes to process, I do it immediately. Otherwise, I move it to a project card on Trello, or snooze it for later.

### 5\. Retrospection, then disconnection

At the end of every week day, when I’m done with my schedule, or too tired to go on:

*   I write down my main achievements of the day;
*   I write down things I learned, and/or need to improve in my workflow;
*   I think of people and things I’m grateful about, and write that down;
*   I write the following day’s schedule on my journal, from my calendar;
*   then I relax at home, or go out!

### **Is this workflow working?**

I’m doing pretty well with it, so far!

After three weeks running this workflow, and with [some help](https://github.com/adrienjoly/chrome-next-step-for-trello/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md), I got [my first product launched successfully on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/next-step-for-trello) (i.e. 750 votes and [2000 users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/next-step-for-trello/iajhmklhilkjgabejjemfbhmclgnmamf) in 7 days).

If you scroll back up to my 13-week roadmap, you’ll see that this achievement validates my first goal, out of the three I had committed to! :-)

### Can anyone expect the same success with this workflow?

I don’t think so.

From the many conversations I’ve had about productivity, my only insight is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

I was amazed by the spectrum of different goals, personalities and behaviors of the people I interviewed. But most importantly, I was impressed by the diversity of solutions that they’ve been using to get things done, and the creativity some of them have shown in elaborating those solutions!

Like many of them, I designed this workflow iteratively, by improving upon more mainstream methods (e.g. ToDo-list apps, Pomodoro technique, GTD, …), and adapting them to my own values, habits, objectives and flaws.

### So, how to become more productive?

If you want to achieve more goals, or make more efficient use of your time and/or willpower, my recommendations for you would be to:

1.  define what you want to achieve, and why; (read “[Why are you doing?](https://sivers.org/why)”, by Derek Sivers)
2.  figure out what are your constraints and flaws; (e.g. [list of usual flaws](http://tinyletter.com/productivity-tips/letters/productivity-tips-21-what-s-your-problem-exactly))
3.  try techniques and tools that solve your problem(s), and improve your workflow iteratively.

Now that I’ve shared all the details of my workflow and these tips, I hope that you’re inspired to design one that fits you well, and that it’ll make all your dreams come true! ^^
