It‚Äôs been a while since my last post, so let‚Äôs see what I‚Äôm doing, and why. üåÖ

I‚Äôm currently **exploring ways to generate an income** from what I enjoy doing most: developing my own products efficiently and independently. üöÄ

Towards that goal, I‚Äôve been exploring three different routes:

1.  streaming [live coding](http://em.getrevue.co/wf/click?upn=ulsvtk73qZ2iMPuGgrjDW0hmmk09j3vjiC8JEE1xV17FGyhhJpG5JwR02CFNoW6C_CPQiI4og-2BY-2FnopFwRNv0mWSLQ2x8cYDNC3YnLr9ytLIO5rPy4vgPi3P4E-2BxmzOKZLgfeQHnhTeyny9hnTUza4UVgM2APX3x1bTJhWVP4MA5n9VXSYHGo4ZOQfSrC8gwILOhF5Wi2GmnLJZDFEs2uv3hn6-2FLoPKOrHEVjmfdxUbQRXrNjcNwcjZvIt5aaNgri4WOHVLkEVB0mhTzl33GZFnNEnSmKRV6nb7LqIXCnnU-2F9lRBtX-2FdSG-2BwinjFwU-2BJNJ7JjtaaOn3Cb75zdmghq1Io-2Fn6z-2FAQ9iVYWn16ina-2FYYfMMRGr-2BDb1Dl3aCG5ajO) üì∫ sessions, (*watch* [*my past sessions on Youtube*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmzn1C-VN6G7FLdUJM3G82cG-Q69xJ2AY))
2.  publishing demos of the tools I developed to make my teaching more time-efficient üìà (videos: [How I create automated programming exams using Markdown and JavaScript](http://em.getrevue.co/wf/click?upn=Cxddp8diHLcW45D85hCuPRukCnd-2FrjdjSv7yKhGgqYkOM-2FcwpKgUOha-2BWrFDwBRsTu8LC7RDckDd-2F6re32r2lA-3D-3D_CPQiI4og-2BY-2FnopFwRNv0mWSLQ2x8cYDNC3YnLr9ytLIO5rPy4vgPi3P4E-2BxmzOKZLgfeQHnhTeyny9hnTUza4UVgM2APX3x1bTJhWVP4MA5n9VXSYHGo4ZOQfSrC8gwILOhF5Wi2GmnLJZDFEs2uv-2B-2BkJJ-2BadaUVrAaZE2Nwh25FCkGhsPAGfxRfI0-2BYeiESQBRcVicQkcEmWltex5DzjDB-2F-2BFvG9hA9bdCfStfCPC5NTobeBrKLkL-2BjlwXQYjkWifNSqqokSJEaxbRbULQPfA0JuxsVvU85BXgV6W1J5hvkxfoexU9vKyTq7BkIMJIX), and [How to evaluate students‚Äô code by hand, and without paper](http://em.getrevue.co/wf/click?upn=Cxddp8diHLcW45D85hCuPRukCnd-2FrjdjSv7yKhGgqYk2ZmCHoXe-2BWgXcBwDnoTI6gP-2Fw7CZ5-2Fd7WQ9Jh0ovEow-3D-3D_CPQiI4og-2BY-2FnopFwRNv0mWSLQ2x8cYDNC3YnLr9ytLIO5rPy4vgPi3P4E-2BxmzOKZLgfeQHnhTeyny9hnTUza4UVgM2APX3x1bTJhWVP4MA5n9VXSYHGo4ZOQfSrC8gwILOhF5Wi2GmnLJZDFEs2uv3j-2Bxg86IhIJT0vlTYa-2FRKCVJbTx88OYh-2Fk6J9oJUrocC-2BvBTXjyTpcFLbSWh4jt0aGNA2tNmTBFwWeQY5GKeIcTR9I4tQiO1JjF6I9Kiua-2FmPAsjzTR2qDx6VT2epYwCepJKccZh74x2L-2FeFJAH8T6E80DtXHKHSc4n7NvTt9vS)),
3.  and collaborating on the development of two productivity apps. üõ† (*more on that soon*)

Below is a 2-minute video I made to quickly demo a tool that I developed to evaluate and grade my students‚Äô source code:

My main problems today are that:

*   As a software developer, I‚Äôve gained experience in product design and management, but **I lack marketing and business development skills**. Whereas non-tech people have plenty of bootcamps to get started with the tech world, I don‚Äôt know how to get started with business‚Ä¶
*   As a believer of the open-source philosophy, I have a natural **aversion to making people pay** for the things I make. As soon as I think that I made something that could benefit to a greater good, I tend to share it freely‚Ä¶

If you have any idea or suggestion on how I could generate an income based on what I‚Äôve been doing, **please share them with me**, that may help me make better decisions on what to invest my energy on! üôå

*I‚Äôm taking the opportunity of this article to thank* [*Poornima Vijayashanker*](https://medium.com/u/ebd37a9be319) *and* [*TheFamily*](https://medium.com/u/c0ef96e7e6c5) *for yesterday‚Äôs talk. It made me realise that I‚Äôm not the only one to have a problem with making people pay. I‚Äôm eager to read Poornima‚Äôs book ‚Äú*[*How to Transform Your Ideas into Software Products*](http://femgineer.com/transform-ideas/)*!‚Äù*

Have a great day!
