This article has nothing to do with what I usually write about, but I have to share this. Hopefully, this article will save a lot of time to other people that may experience the same problems as me with a Ccbetter 720 Action Camera with Wifi (alternative to GoPro).

After unpacking it, charging the battery and putting in a SD card, the camera worked beautifully!

Problems started as soon as I tried to connect it to my Nexus 5x phone with Android M (6.0.1): none of the recommended apps (iSmart DV, Youmera, Finalcam, Canany) were able to connect to the camera… I was always getting a “add device fail” error.

After hours of retries, including with my old iPhone 4s, and a few useless exchanges with ccbetter’s customer support, I finally returned the camera to the Amazon seller, and my girlfriend ordered it again from another seller.

So my second ccbetter camera was delivered today, and I experienced the same issues at first… On the Nexus 5x and the iPhone 4s…

I tried everything: turning on Bluetooth, switching Wifi networks, disabling 4G data, disabling battery optimisation, giving all possible permissions to camera apps… Nothing was working…

<figcaption>This time, my new ccbetter camera has an up-to-date firmware!</figcaption>

But, out of the blue, after trying 10 different apps on both phones, the Canany app finally displayed the camera’s image! I had started it after turning on the Wifi mode on the camera, and connecting the Nexus’ to that SSID. I tried again all the other apps, but only Canany was working in those same conditions.

I assume that ccbetter’s firmware (or Canany) was recently updated, in order to support Android M.

I lost too many hours trying to make this work, but in the end I’m really happy that it does!

I hope that it will work for you too, because this camera seems fantastic!
