Thank you for these links, Mario!

I like the fact that opencollective encourages transparency of expenses. It’s indeed great for open-source teams who are looking for ways to crowdsource their expenses. It would not be a good match for me though, because I have no “expenses” to cover, but my actual personal income.

Your idea of sponsorfunding is also great! Unfortunately I didn’t find examples of software projects on the website. Only podcasts. Do you have any to share, for inspiration?
