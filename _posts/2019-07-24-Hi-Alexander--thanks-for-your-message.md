Hi Alexander, thanks for your message!

I do have some experience with an external kick pedal: I bought a “Triggera Krigg V3 Kick Pedal Trigger” ([https://www.thomann.de/fr/triggera\_krigg\_v3\_kick\_pedal\_trigger.htm](https://www.thomann.de/fr/triggera_krigg_v3_kick_pedal_trigger.htm)) and attached it to a regular kick pedal that I already owned => it works great!

Don’t hesitate to ask if you have other questions.

Adrien
