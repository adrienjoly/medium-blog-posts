Hi, friends!

Today, I’d like to tease you about **a new productivity add-on** I’m working on: **Trello Outliner**.

(*play the video below to see what it is about*)

* * *

<figcaption>Teasing video I made for <a href="https://adrienjoly.com/trello-outliner/" data-href="https://adrienjoly.com/trello-outliner/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trello Outliner’s landing page</a></figcaption>

* * *

I’m not teasing because I’m mean!

I’m teasing you because it may take a lot of effort to turn this idea into something real. And I’d like to make sure that it would be **useful to many of you** before investing that time!

* * *

If you were too lazy to watch the video, here’s a summary of my idea:

*   Trello card comments are useful to **keep notes** about our projects.
*   They are **easy to update**, but at some cost: Trello’s UI makes it too easy to **accidentally exit** the “edit mode” without saving our changes, and too hard to **re-structure ideas** as hierarchical bullet points.
*   So I’m proposing an alternative **comment editor** that would open in its own browser tab (for better **focus**), and allow easy restructuring of bullet points using the TAB key and/or drag&drop (i.e. like **outliners**, if you’re familiar with products like [workflowy](https://workflowy.com)).

### **Would you use something like that?**

> (*please reply honestly!*)
