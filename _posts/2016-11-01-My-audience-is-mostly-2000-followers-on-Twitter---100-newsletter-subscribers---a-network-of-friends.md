My audience is mostly 2000 followers on Twitter + 100 newsletter subscribers + a network of friends and clients who trust me.

I realize that I didn’t write about that in my article, but my intention it to keep writing, building and sharing good content online, making it link to the Patreon (or whatever else) page for those who want to subscribe to support my work.

For now, creating value and attracting subscribers on livecoding.tv seems like a great first step, because it’s less hard to set up, and the audience is more used to programmers than Patreon.

I’m very open to alternatives, as long as they make sense for me and don’t eat up too much of my time. So feel free to contact at adrienjoly.com if you want to discuss more about this!

Thanks for your help, Mario, I appreciate it! :-)
