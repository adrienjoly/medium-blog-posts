### ðŸ”® Promoting Openwhyd to contributors andÂ donators

![](/images/Current-status--Giving-away-products-and-responsibilities/1*N93pPe4JQpaKpNJkN04PDQ.png)

<figcaption>Summary of proposed projects and duties towards Openwhyd&nbsp;2.0</figcaption>

On Wednesday, I presented **the story of Openwhyd**, its current status and my wishes for its future, at the [Node.js Paris meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Nodejs-Paris/events/243877814/).

One of the most important [slides](http://adrienjoly.com/slides/openwhyd-2017/) I displayed is the one above, because it shows **exciting opportunities** for contributors to join and take an impactful role in the [collaborative project](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd).

At that occasion, I let the audience know that I was willing to **give away** most of my roles and responsibilities (including decisional ones) to motivate contributors who were excited and determined to take them. So let me know if you want to know more!

### ðŸŽ€ Open-sourced my auto-grading evaluation suite!

<figcaption>This is how exams I give to my students look&nbsp;like</figcaption>

Js-test has probably been my **biggest solo project**. I developed it in order to evaluate my students more efficiently, and used it to give them daily quizzes, self-graded training exercises and exams.

It **saved me so much time** over the years that I even had considered to commercialise it, at some point.

But now that Iâ€™m tired of my entrepreneurial efforts, I decided to release it [publicly on Github](https://github.com/adrienjoly/js-test), as an open-source project! (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French teachers: [read this announcement](http://us12.campaign-archive.com/?u=c1cfafd58fc9699f6d5a661e2&id=96bf48ca3c))

Now, Iâ€™m curious to see if itâ€™s **useful to fellow teachers**! Happy to read your thoughts on this, if any.

**Thatâ€™s it for today!** Have a scary Halloween and talk to you soon! ðŸ‘»
