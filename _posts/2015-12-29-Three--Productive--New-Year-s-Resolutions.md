> How is the end of the year going for you?

Did you receive gifts that pleased you? Or maybe you’ve put everything online for sale? ;-)

This time of year is a great opportunity for retrospective, for identifying things that you want to improve on, and also for hopeful thoughts for the year to come!

I take this opportunity to suggest a few methods that you may want to try in 2016!

* * *

#### **1\. Try the GTD technique to declutter your mind and improve your memory**

[Getting Things Done](http://www.theshapeshiftersclub.com/how-to-declutter-your-mind-and-improve-your-memory-in-3-simple-steps/) is the name of a technique that consists in:

*   **capturing** / writing down everything you have in mind,
*   doing **quick tasks** as soon as possible,
*   and classifying other tasks so that you can **plan** to do them at the right time, and in the right context.

You may have heard the phrase “**Inbox Zero**” before. Keeping your email inbox clean is one way of feeling less overwhelmed, and it’s one good application of the GTD technique.

#### 2\. Decide to beat procrastination

> Do you feel like **your mind** has a mind of its own?  
> It **wanders off**, venturing into various directions, without your permission…  
> Or maybe, it sneakily gets you to agree to have ‘**just one little look**’ at your emails/FB account/or some other innocent and quick activity and then takes off and gets you lost for much longer than you indented to?  
> Do you feel like you’re **juggling multiple ideas** at the same time? \[…\]

> The **lack of mental focus** that results from it, not only **gets in the way of our productivity**, but also **affect our happiness.** \[…\]  
> **Wandering mind is an unhappy mind.**

By putting the previous tip into practice, your mind should already feel lighter, less overwhelmed.

By capturing not only “tasks”, but also your **free-range thoughts** (e.g. ideas and other unrelated urges), you should feel even better, and **more at peace** for doing the tasks you wanted to do today.

Once you’ve reached that point, you can **follow** [**Joanna’s tricks**](http://www.theshapeshiftersclub.com/how-to-manage-free-range-thoughts-bursts-of-ideas-and-other-challenges-of-a-wandering-mind/) to:

*   bring your wandering mind to here & now: identify/acknowledge/let go;
*   adopt (and adapt) ‘*snap-me-out-of-it*’ tricks to refocus.

> **cut through your mental noise/clutter with sensory input** **using your vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste and somatic receptors**. We all have different sensory preferences, so again — see whatever works for you.

> It’s as simple as looking around and **naming 5 things you see**, hear, smell, feel (touch) etc. around you. You can use your taste (e.g. make yourself a cup of tea/coffee and sip on it when you feel distracted; **savour the taste**) and **physical activity** (take a few deep breaths, stretch, wave your hand; wear a rubber band on your wrist and snap lightly when you want to refocus).

#### 3\. The quest of the Holy Flow

Now that we’ve talked about planning and focus, the most powerful way to be productive is to actually enjoy doing your tasks.

> [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)*:* Named by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, \[…\] **Flow**, also known as **the zone**, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully **immersed** in a feeling of **energized focus**, full involvement, and **enjoyment** in the process of the activity.

Flow is best explained by the following picture:

When you do something that you are too skilled for, chances are that you will be **bored**. On the other hand, if a task is so challenging that you don’t know where to start, you’ll probably feel **anxious**. In both situations, you can easily fall in **procrastination** mode…

So, in order to avoid these situations, you have to find a way to execute your tasks while navigating between anxiety and boredom, by **leveraging the right skills** and **adjusting the level of challenge** you need to feel excited by the execution of your task.

I hope that these ideas will inspire you, and help you enjoy getting many interesting things done in 2016!

Productively,
