Hi Jaker, thanks for asking!

As a matter of fact I enjoyed undertaking various experiences with the DTX:

*   I played some covers with 2 differents bands, live, for an audience, like if it was a regular drumkit, using 2 pedals: kick and HH. It felt and sounded great!
*   I programmed a OPL-3 kit (i.e. using samples from Adlib/Soundblaster drum sounds that were used in games I used to play when I was a kid) and play on it using my fingers: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_GVbGXrMLJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GVbGXrMLJc)
*   I recorded a drums track to jam with other musiciens through imujam.com: [https://www.imujam.com/fr/jams/152](https://www.imujam.com/fr/jams/152)

The DTX 12 is awesome, I still recommend it! If you end up buying it, please let me know what you do with it!
