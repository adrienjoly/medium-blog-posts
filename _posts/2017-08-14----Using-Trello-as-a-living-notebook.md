**I can‚Äôt help it**: I can‚Äôt stop working on multiple projects simultaneously.¬†  
**I need this diversity**. It makes me learn faster, and feeds my creativity.

In previous articles, I shared my intention of [developing multiple 1-day side-projects](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/chaque-semaine-1-jour-pour-r%C3%A9aliser-1-id%C3%A9e-f77c9a2b2c74?source=user_profile---------23--------------), [Matthieu introduced the concept of ‚Äúproject journal‚Äù](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/achieve-your-dreams-while-complying-to-commitments-a-productive-interview-of-matthieu-leventis-ddacd02f3249), then I explained [why Trello become the heart of my productivity system](https://byrslf.co/work-on-12-projects-without-burning-out-f5bec50dafdb).

Today, I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce a new Power-up for Trello: ‚Äú[Comment Editor by AJ](https://info.trello.com/power-ups/comment-editor).‚Äù Let‚Äôs see how you can use it to keep both your projects‚Äô checklists and notes in the same place!

* * *

### Why Trello is awesome to keep track of your¬†projects

When working on any project, there are several types of information that need to be specified and maintained over time:

*   **Tasks**: steps that need to be followed in order to progress;
*   **Status**: know what‚Äôs been done and what‚Äôs still to do, at all times;
*   **Notes**: traces of the decisions, successes, failed experiments, and findings you‚Äôve made while working on the projet.

With Trello, there are at least two ways to achieve this:

*   **One board per project**, containing one card per task ‚Üí columns can be used to visualise the status of each task. (e.g. ToDo, Doing, Done‚Ä¶)
*   **One card per project**, with tasks listed in a checklist ‚Üí practical setup to keep a bird‚Äôs view dashboard of all the projects you‚Äôre working on.

As you may have guessed, I‚Äôm using the **second setup**.

My master board looks like this:

<figcaption>The Trello board that is the heart of my productivity system: one card per&nbsp;project.</figcaption>

Ok, don‚Äôt freak out, I cheated a bit‚Ä¶ I had developed an add-on in order to display the **next task** to be done on each Project card: [Next Step for Trello](https://adrienjoly.com/chrome-next-step-for-trello/).

That being said, you can see that I work on **various kinds of projects**: professional projects (*e.g. EEMI, MOOC*), side-projects (*e.g. A+Z, OpenWhyd*), personal projects (*e.g. Personal Development, Burning Man*), and hobbies (*e.g. Music*).

Feel free to **chose the right setup** (or both), based on the number of projects you‚Äôre working on, and the level of control you want to have on those projects.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about why **notes** matter, and how they fit in there.

* * *

### The importance of¬†notes

In the previous section, we saw that three types of information must be maintained, in projects: tasks, status and notes. And we showed that Trello was an awesome tool to manage tasks and status of those tasks.

What about notes? And why should we care?

**Notes are very valuable**, in many ways.

Examples:

*   to **remember** how and why you proceeded the way you did;
*   to **document** your project and its development process;
*   to **keep** ideas you may have had and not explored while working on the project, but would be interested in exploring later;
*   or for **reference**, if you decide later to write and/or share about your findings.

So is Trello well suited to handle notes? ü§î

> Yes and¬†no.

In Trello, **notes can easily be kept in three forms**:

*   in a dedicated card (i.e. one card per note);
*   in a card‚Äôs description;
*   and/or as comments of a card.

Best suited for a ‚Äúone board per project‚Äù setup, the **first form** has the advantage of making the note highly visible.

On the other hand, the **two latter forms** offer two major advantages:

*   Notes are kept in the context of their card, making them **easily findable** when searching for keywords that are associated with that card; (*e.g. a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget to test this!‚Äù note of a ‚Äúlogin system‚Äù card can easily be found by typing just ‚Äúlogin‚Äù in Trello‚Äôs search bar, even though this keyword is not part of the note itself*)
*   In Trello, card descriptions and comments both support **Markdown**, meaning that you can add **richer formatting** to your notes.

Examples of rich notes that can be taken in Trello, thanks to Markdown formatting:

<figcaption>Trello comments allow Markdown formatting, emoji, rich hyperlinks, and multi-level bullet-point lists.</figcaption>

As you can see above, support for **Markdown formatting, emoji, rich hyperlinks and multi-level bullet-point lists** make Trello card comments a very pleasant place to keep notes!

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the darker side of Trello card comments: the editing experience.

* * *

### What‚Äôs missing in Trello¬†comments

Now that we realised how awesome are Trello comments for keeping and finding notes, let‚Äôs discuss a not-so-great aspect: **the editing experience**.

That‚Äôs how the two notes shown above look like when you edit them:

![](/images/---Using-Trello-as-a-living-notebook/1*LXWZZNIknCPLB19hmvwI5Q.png)

<figcaption>Standard Trello experience when editing card&nbsp;comments</figcaption>

Trello‚Äôs standard comment editing experience is quite poor, compared to how comments look like after saving your changes:

*   the **formatting** is not displayed; (e.g. bold text)
*   **hyperlinks** become hard to differentiate from the rest of the content.

But, most importantly:

*   experience-wise, you feel stuck in a small box within Trello‚Äôs UI, which does not make it easy to **focus** on your notes while writing them;
*   it‚Äôs too easy to **lose your changes** by accidentally clicking anywhere outside that box, or pressing the ESC key;
*   and **re-organising bullet-point items** involves copy-pasting, and padding sub-bullet-point manually by adding spaces in front of them!

We‚Äôre very far away from the ease and comfort of a typical note-taking tool!

And, if you like **hierarchical bullet lists**, editing them in Trello‚Äôs standard comment editor is painful. Especially if you‚Äôve ever used an **Outliner** before:

<figcaption>Demo of a well-done Outliner: Workflowy. (<a href="https://www.process.st/take-better-notes/" data-href="https://www.process.st/take-better-notes/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source</a>)</figcaption>

For those who don‚Äôt know what an Outliner is: it‚Äôs a **hierarchical note editor** that allows users to move items up and down the hierarchy by using drag-and-drop gestures, and/or the TAB key to re-indent items.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to be able to edit our notes that way, but still in Trello?

### ‚ÄúComment Editor by AJ‚Äù to the rescue!¬†üí™

Frustrated by the standard comment editing experience offered by Trello, I created a Power-up: ‚Äú[Comment Editor by AJ](https://info.trello.com/power-ups/comment-editor).‚Äù (*previously announced under the code name ‚ÄúTrello Outliner‚Äù*)

After activating this power-up, you can use it to edit any existing comment. It will open a full-screen editor with rich formatting:

Like an outliner, this editor allows you to re-organise bullet point items very quickly. This is very convenient to structure ideas and plan complex activities, like trips:

With this add-on installed on my main Trello Board, I completely got rid of **notes stored as text files** on my laptop‚Äôs desktop, or emails sent to myself!

Hopefully it will help you too!
