You may know that I love my work and I love traveling. But I hate the feeling of not having got enough stuff done during the day. And I hate the feeling of not having chosen my activities wisely.

> Hi, my name is Adrien, and I’m a productivity addict.

Even if it’s not easy to perform great everyday, I found that **ticking checkboxes** is very rewarding for me, and motivating me to achieve more. While working remotely, I also found out that I cannot always control my context. So I learnt how to adapt to **uncertainty**, without losing time or causing frustration.

After reading (too) many articles about productivity, and many months of experimentation, I’ve reached a **process** that I think is worth sharing with you today.

*If, like me, you’ve already read too much productivity tips, feel free to skip to the “My ToDo lists” section. Otherwise, I advise you to read the following tips first.*

#### **Tip 1: Productivity towards your own goals, and happiness**

> **Productivity** isn’t a goal, but rather **a tool** for better achieving our goals.  
> To be productive in the most meaningful sense, we need to be able to step back and ask ourselves what **goals** we really care about, and why.

After [making her point](http://qz.com/547414/the-cult-of-productivity-is-preventing-you-from-being-productive), Jess shares a few great tips:

*   Plan and **schedule your tasks of the day**, every morning;
*   Pick each task by **asking yourself** if it will make you feel good;
*   Regularly ask yourself **how you feel**, and what you could do to feel better.

#### Tip 2: You can’t control everything, and that’s OK.

[Aaron Swartz said it best](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity):

> “With all the time you spend watching TV,” he tells me, “you could have written a novel by now.” \[…\]  
> **Time has various levels of quality**. \[…\] And it’s tough to focus when you keep getting interrupted. There’s also a mental component: sometimes I feel happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.  
> If you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact and deal with it. First, you have to **make the best of each kind of time**. And second, you have to try to **make your time higher-quality**.

Following Aaron’s advice, the tasks I would like to get done should not be in one list, but in different lists, depending on my context. (place, mood, etc…)

#### Tip 3: Prevent distractions, but plan time-offs

[As Chris explains](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-work-40-hours-in-16-7-the-simple-technique-that-gave-me-my-life-back-8f98ec011862#.7ydwi03l5), we can’t stay in *focus mode* all the time. But we can interlace short bursts of focused work with breaks:

> I had to figure out **how to work smarter, not harder**. \[…\] Slowly but surely, Pomodoro has forever changed how I work… \[…\]  
> That’s **25 minutes** of steady, focused work on **ONE task**. No multitasking. No emails. No phone calls. No checking Facebook. Nothing! No distractions allowed.

Pomodoro is one way to prevent the guilt of checking Facebook or Twitter in the middle of a task. But it does not matter how you achieve that, as long as you commit to focus solely on your tasks for a few minutes, then allow yourself some well-deserved relief time for other activities. (e.g. Facebook if you really enjoy that, or something happening in the real world)

#### Tip 4: Bake your own routine, and stick to it

Let Robin inspire you with [the following story](http://www.robinsharma.com/blog/04/become-a-rockstar-of-productivity/):

> A major financial player \[…\] shared that he’d recently brought NBA legend‎ **Magic Johnson** to speak to his corporate team. Magic spoke of the fact that during one season Larry Bird **dominated** him when it came to free throw success. And so, **Magic vowed** that the next year, he’d show Bird his own mastery. For the next 6 months, Magic built the following **morning routine**: he’d wake early and go down to his home basketball court. And he wouldn’t leave until he’d make **100 successful free throws. In a row**. Some days, Magic would be done by 7 am. Other days he’d still be shooting at noon. But he never left before making his 100 daily consecutive free throws‎. It was a **dedicated routine**. The next year, **Magic Johnson beat his rival** Larry Bird in free throws.

Here are other selected parts from [her article](http://www.robinsharma.com/blog/04/become-a-rockstar-of-productivity/) that I love:

*   The thing that’s **easiest** to do is rarely the thing that’s the **best** thing to do.
*   Things you do **regularly** are 100X more important than those things you do rarely.
*   Spend the **first 90 minutes** of your workday on your #1 opportunity.
*   Check your email after lunch. Make your phone calls in the afternoon. **Surf the Net in the evening**.
*   Inspiration isn’t some random event. No, it’s an **organized result**.

### My ToDo lists, and how I use them

Based on the foundations provided above, and my own preferences, I decided to apply the following rules:

*   I store tasks in **different lists**, for each usual type of context.
*   Every morning, I **split new tasks** into smaller tasks, give them a very clear and unambiguous title, then classify them into contextual lists. That way, I can dilute boring/scary tasks into steps so small that I accept to do one of them each day.
*   Every morning, I **decide** which tasks I want to get done today.
*   I **track time** spent on each task, and allow myself some free “leisure” time between tasks.
*   I **avoid** [**procrastination**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) by not allowing “leisure” activities to be accounted in my time-tracked work periods. (or I have to stop the timer)
*   When I’m done with my tasks of the day, I can tap into any list I like, including **leisure**\-related lists.

Below are the lists that I use with my current ToDo-list app.

> Note that the app itself does not matter. You can apply the same process using just good old paper and pencil.

#### Core lists

*   **Inbox**: I put all my notes and ideas in this list. Especially from my smartphone, on the move. I sort and classify them every morning.
*   **Today** (smart list): contains all the tasks I had planned to do today. (tasks from any list appear in that list when they are due today)
*   **My Today**: a list that I populate every morning, from my “Inbox” and “Today” lists. I usually put between 1 and 5 tasks in that list everyday, and intend to make it empty by the end of the day.
*   **!Waiting**: in that list, I add all the things that I’m waiting for, and that I don’t want to forget. (ex: expected deliveries and payments, stuff lent to friends, photos I want to gather from other people…) I use it to remind the corresponding people that I’m still waiting!

#### Contextual lists

*   **Admin**: boring but necessary tasks. (e.g. monthly accounting)
*   **Pro**: work-related tasks. (e.g. code for current project)
*   **To blog**: ideas / topics I would like to blog about.
*   **Groceries**: …and other things I need to buy when I’m outside.
*   **Activities**: outside activities I would like to do someday. (e.g. restaurants, visits…)
*   **Geek activities**: week-end projects and other cool ideas I would like to do at home (e.g. turn my spare laptop into a media center)
*   **Music to listen to**: in that list, I paste and bookmark URLs of music that I freshly discovered, or was recommended to give an ear to.
*   **Videos to watch**: URLs of videos (usually technical) that I would like to watch someday. (most of them were added using a bookmarklet)
*   **Films to watch**: films that I would like to watch someday.
*   **Stuff to sell**: list of items that I own but don’t need anymore.
*   **Bucket list**: achievements, travels, or other big activities that I would like to do before I die.

#### Public lists

*   [**Ideas**](https://www.wunderlist.com/list/131400047/embed): ideas of software (or business)I’d love to build, during a hackathon, or as a side-project. I share it publicly and maintain it regularly as a proof that ideas are not worth keeping to oneself. It happens that strangers or acquaintances contact me to collaborate on those ideas.
*   [**Looking for**](https://www.wunderlist.com/list/148708042/embed): a list of skills or services I’m currently looking for, or need advice on. This is like a wish-list for people who want to help me, or to collaborate with me. It contains great icebreakers for strangers who want to ask me something! ;-)

#### Bonus: GTD-style contexts that I’m considering to add

*   **Offline focus**: tasks that I can do in a quiet environment without Internet connection (e.g. writing a blog post in the train)
*   **Online focus**: tasks that I can do in a quiet environment with Internet connection (e.g. write code for my clients at home)
*   **Online work**: tasks that just require a good Internet connection (e.g. download system updates, upload/backup photos and videos, fill out some administrative forms…)
*   **Phone calls**: tasks that must take place where I can have a phone (or skype) conversation without bothering anyone, nor being bothered by anyone.

#### And you?

As some of you may have guessed, I’ve been using Wunderlist to manage my tasks. But, as written above, it does not matter what software you use. I picked Wunderlist because it was popular (and thus, reliable), multi-platform, free, and because it has an API that I can play with.

*Now, I would love to read how* ***you*** *deal with tasks, and productivity in general!*
