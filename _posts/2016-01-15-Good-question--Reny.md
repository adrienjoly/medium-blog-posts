Good question, Reny!

Being in the zone is great because it makes you do great work, and keeps you hooked to the task. There is a danger, however: while being in the zone, you may also drift away from the initial objectives of your task, e.g. by putting to much attention on a meaningless detail.

So my best answer would be to keep planning tasks with a clear objectif and reasonable expected duration, and make your best to stay on track.

If you’re able to do that, you may indeed lose a little bit of “zone”, but you’ll feel great anyway because you’ll tick boxes on your todo-list more often, at the end of the day.

Of course my advice does not apply to free-time/fun/creative side-projects! ^^
