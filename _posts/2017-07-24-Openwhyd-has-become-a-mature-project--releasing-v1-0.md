### Dear musicÂ lovers,

I would like to welcome, congratulate and thank the developers [Julien Tanay](https://twitter.com/djiit), [Nicolas Leger](https://twitter.com/inicolasleger) and [Marin le Maignan](https://twitter.com/marinlemaignan) for making [Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org/) a **higher-quality product**, and a more welcoming [open-source project](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd).

Thanks to their contributions, itâ€™s become easier than ever for anyone to **install and edit Openwhyd on their own computer**! And automated tests are still being written to ease contributions, while preventing them from accidentally breaking features.

<figcaption>Major chances of v1.0, since the Whyd startup company gave us the source code of their&nbsp;product.</figcaption>

Thatâ€™s why, one year after whyd.com became openwhyd.org, Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the first stable release of our codebase: [version 1.0](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd/releases/tag/v1.0)! **Thanks for your help, guys!**

Before we start discussing ideas and filling the roadmap to Openwhyd version 2.0, Iâ€™d also like to thank the team that built the initial Whyd product ([Gilles Poupardin](https://medium.com/u/754d86ecf9d5), [Jie Meng-GÃ©rard](https://medium.com/u/7095290ca777), [LoÃ¯ck](https://medium.com/u/7f1d671bca14), [Tony Hymes](https://medium.com/u/b6e00d8cc3bc) and [Damien](https://medium.com/u/54284c447fa0)), the volunteers who have been helping on non-tech tasks ([Kler Marion](https://medium.com/u/accbbd54b413), Constance Betinyani, Mathilde Vercelletto, [FranÃ§ois Burra](https://medium.com/u/d925734db8c8), [Henri Lieutaud](https://medium.com/u/9954b82ab718), Grey Vugrin and [Alberto Fantappie](https://medium.com/u/9a571d5edfce)), and of course [our backers on Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/openwhyd):
