I’ve always hated doing research. Looking up stuff online, rephrasing… It always felt like a machine could have achieved better results, and hence save my time.

When I was a kid, we were asked to do **homework research** about several topics, especially in literature class. And I hated it. Especially when I finally got access to the internet, because I knew that we were all going to **copy and paste** chunks of text from some top-result encyclopedia page or article, and **pretend** that we wrote it ourselves by rephrasing most of it, without adding any kind of value. I’ve always thought it was a pure waste of time.

You may say that it was a silly move for me to undertake a 3-year PhD thesis, then! As you can guess, I also hated that part of reading **too many papers**, and taking notes for reference. At least it implied the intellectual challenge of positioning my own research contribution by referring to others’ research. But still, I hated it.

And now, I’m finding myself doing research. **Again**. And, for the second time, this was my own decision. I’m co-writing a MOOC on the Lean Startup methodology, so I have to do some research on techniques I have not personally used yet. But this time, I realise that **it’s not that boring to do**. Why? Because this time, I know that I’m writing it for a meaningful **purpose** (*teach people*), for a specific **audience** (*wantrepreneurs*), and with a personally-chosen **tone** (*that tech guy that hates bullshit and wasting people’s time, but loves to make complex things simple*). All these **creative constraints** make me happy to do the research!

So, when I think about my school years, I can’t help but being mad towards my teachers. For not having given us **more creative constraints** when they asked us to do research. I would have enjoyed writing that article about Charlotte Brontë, if I had been asked to tell her story like if it was a kid’s fairy tale! I would not have minded doing a summary of Camus’ The Stanger, if I had been asked to present it like a TV news presenter, together with one of my classmates!

*That being said, I have to go back my research, or you may call me a procrastinator! ;-)*
