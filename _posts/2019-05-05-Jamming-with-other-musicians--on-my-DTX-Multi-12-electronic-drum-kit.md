This weekend, I discovered “[ImuJam](http://imujam.com)”, a website on which musicians can record their performances and contribute to others’.

I thought this was a pretty cool thing to try, but then I realised that recoding my electronic drum kit through my laptop’s microphone would include the sound of my drum sticks hitting the pads, which would sound bad…

So I figured out a way to make this work:

*   plug my DTX Multi-12 drum kit to my computer using a MIDI cable;
*   pick a drum sound that I like on Ableton Live 10, and make sure that its track listens to my MIDI input;
*   create a custom pad mapping on the DTX, for additional comfort while performing;
*   configure Ableton Live to send the audio to “Multi-Output Device”;

*   configure that “Multi-Output Device” from my Mac’s “Audio MIDI Setup” utility, so that it sends audio signal to both the built-in output (i.e. my headphones) and to a virtual audio device: *in my case, “Apowersoft Audio Device” came with* [*Apowersoft Screen Recorder*](https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder)*. (Free download)*

*   configure Google Chrome to use that virtual audio device instead of the built-in input device.

In short, this makes Google Chrome use the audio from Ableton Live like if it was my Mac’s microphone!

### That’s it!
