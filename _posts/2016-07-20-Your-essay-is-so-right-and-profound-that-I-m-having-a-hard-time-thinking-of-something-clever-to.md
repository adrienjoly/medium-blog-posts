Your essay is so right and profound that I’m having a hard time thinking of something clever to reply…

As a developer, I think that I’m experiencing the same paradox:

*   I love telling people how to create startups and fail fast for the better, I love building dozens of mini-apps and let them rot on a Heroku instance (“*just in case”*), I love optimising stuff, I love the promise of “changing the world” or “improve people’s lives”.
*   At the same time I have that feeling that this frenzy of apps and other tech products I contribute to is not sustainable. Nor it is *Good* for anyone or anything, at the end of the day.

I’m not sure if I’m drifting. Maybe I’m just dizzy. Or at least confused by that subconscious struggle. It could be one of the reasons why I feel anxious at times, without apparent cause.

What keeps me from losing my mind is the idea that a (very) small portion of this tech frenzy can actually improve the world.

Ideas like crowdsourcing government decisions, helping farmers distribute their vegetables locally, all these MOOC and e-learning sites that bring education to unreached masses… There is still hope; hooray!

I really hope to soon find a way to align my passion for building tech products with the vision of a sustainable and better future!

I believe that one of the first challenges we will need to solve is to re-educate all the victims of FOMO, and all kinds of addiction brought by social networks and other mainstream platforms that we’ve become used to. (Pokémon GO, anyone?) Learn how to slow down, disconnect, look outside, and enjoy the now.

I’d love to talk with you again some day, Tariq!

Thank you again for sharing these words of wisdom with us!
