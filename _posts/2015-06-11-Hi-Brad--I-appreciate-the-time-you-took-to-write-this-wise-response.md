Hi Brad, I appreciate the time you took to write this wise response.

I agree with you on all your points.

Indeed, I already apply all of them (when relevant), but the first. In the sake of karma, I’m also participating to non-profit activities such as free advising afternoons (1cupexpert), and helping people from my city repair their computers and home equipment. I know that it’s not exactly what you had in mind, but it makes me interact with other kinds of people and I would not meet otherwise, and I have fun doing it.

Thank you for your feedback and advice!

Adrien
