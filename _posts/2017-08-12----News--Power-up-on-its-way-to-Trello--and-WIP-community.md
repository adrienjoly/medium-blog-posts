### 1\. Win: Power-up on its way to Trello 💪

![](/images/---News--Power-up-on-its-way-to-Trello--and-WIP-community/0*tn1L1W29VdMq5Nnw..jpg)

On Tuesday, August 8th, I **received an email from** [**Trello**](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/trello) announcing great news: they accept to include my Outliner in their official list of Power-ups, making it publicly available from any Trello board! 🎉

We decided to launch it on Thursday, 17th. At that occasion, I’ll publish an article to present what “[Comment Editor by AJ](http://devpost.com/software/trello-outliner-lpv3zt)” is for, why I built it, and why you need it too!

Right now, **I need**:

\- help to kill all the bugs (*beta testing on* [*that board*](https://trello.com/invite/b/C1BeGLFW/755950e252ae81aeb6c899187fab1be2/outliner-test-board-production) *is appreciated*);

\- use cases and testimonials from users, for my upcoming article.

So, if you love Trello, I would highly appreciate your help!

### 2\. Sharing progress and praise in WIP 🙌

You know that I love **developing new (side-)projects**, and find it hard and frustrating to work in “tunnel mode” (*work alone for months, and then try to launch successfully*).

Based on advice from the book “[Show Your Work](https://medium.com/show-your-work/10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-7fb5fdfbc068)” by Austin Kleon, I was looking for **a benevolent forum** in which people developing (side-)projects could share their progress (and process), and get praise & feedback in return.

Thanks to [levels.io](https://medium.com/u/75452cb7f664), I discovered that “spectrum.chat” was a very good product for **creating that** [**community**](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/community), because it’s public and open to anyone (contrary to Slack).

**So I used it** to create that community: [https://spectrum.chat/wip](https://spectrum.chat/wip)  
(*“Work In Progress” is the name of the community*)

If you want to share your progress, help others build awesome products, and/or learn how other makers do it, **come join us!** 💪

**That’s it for today!**

I’m leaving soon for a trip to the USA with my girlfriend, and best friends! We’ll be at Burning Man, so let me know if you’ll be there too!

✌️
