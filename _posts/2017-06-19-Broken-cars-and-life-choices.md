**The last two weeks have been quite odd.**

My parents visited us for a few days. My car broke. Then, I ended up spending way too much time dealing with emails, maintenance of side projects, and thinking about life choices…

***…instead of prospecting clients for my business, as I intended.***

### Am I lying to myself? — Part 2

A few weeks ago, I wrote about the realisation that [I was not the super developer I thought I was](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/im-not-the-10x-developer-i-thought-i-was-acad63d059a4). Now, I’m wondering if **creating my own business** is not yet another ego-driven challenge that I’m inflicting to myself. What is it that I’m running after, exactly?

[Derek Sivers advises](https://sivers.org/career) to **keep your real passion as a hobby**, while learning to master (and thus, enjoy) a well-paid job to ensure a sustainable future. My family and some of my friends think that way. But, to me, this sounds boring, for some reason. While I’m quite risk-averse, I like to think that I have a chance of achieving something bigger. So I’m **trying things**.

On the other hand, while “trying things” sounds fun and instructive, it also sounds random and unpurposeful. Having a purpose (“[WHY](https://sivers.org/why)”) is important to stay motivated, especially when dealing with hard or unpleasant tasks. So, if I want to follow that route, I believe that I need to have a direction in mind. I need to **know what I want, and what I don’t want**. And, these days, I’m having trouble figuring this out…

Or maybe I should accept that [we’re all delusional](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/21/15660894/insight-self-awareness-psychology-tasha-eurich-interview?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter), that I should stop overthinking all this, and rather ask my friends for their point of view.

**I’d love to read your take on this:**

1.  **When you make life choices, what drives you?**
2.  **Don’t you see a contradiction between the two articles by Derek Sivers I linked above?**
3.  **When working on a project that you believe is driven by your purpose, how much “pain” (or boring tasks) are you ready to tolerate before quitting or reconsidering your purpose?**
