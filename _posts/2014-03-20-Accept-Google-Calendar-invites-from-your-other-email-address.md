Accept Google Calendar invites from your other email address

* * *

If you’re a Google Calendar user, you receive GCal invitations that were sent to another email address of yours, and you cannot accept them just because they were not sent to your Google email address (the one to which your GCal is associated), you are not alone.

You can actually accept GCal invites from any email address, by following these two steps:

1.  Declare your other email address as secondary email in your Google Account settings,
2.  Check the box in GCal settings allowing to accept invites from secondary email addresses. (you can find it in the “Notifications” section, for your main personal calendar)

That’s it !

…and if you these steps are too vague for you, you can read [a bigger explanation](http://www.tekgrl.com/2013/06/27/accepting-google-calendar-invites-to-a-non-gmail-account/), or even more detailed explanation: [Add alternate email addresses for calendar scheduling](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/quick-tip-add-alternate-email-addresses-for-calendar-scheduling/).
