That’s impressive, Alex! How long have you been doing that? Did you also ditch the IM features of collaboration tools within projects you’re currently involved in? How did your manage with the (probably negative) reaction of your friends and acquaintances? (sorry for all these questions, but I’m very interested in your experience)
