Hi Karuppiah!

Thank you so much for having contributed to open-source projects AND for having shared your experience with us!

As I’m leading an open-source project — *a product that my ex-startup gave back to its community of users before pivoting* — for the first time of my life, I would be definitely interested in your advice on how to improve our contribution guidelines, in order to attract more contributors.

This project is a Node.js web app to curate and play music tracks from several streaming platforms: Youtube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, etc…

You can find our repo there: github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd

I’d love to read from you soon, if you’re interested in collaborating! :-)

Have a great day!

Adrien
