You’re absolutely right, Lior! While I do keep my phone on “do not disturb” mode while I’m busy, having a conversation over the phone with friends and family is definitely something I enjoy!

In order to make myself available for this kind of call, I usually plan a little bit in advance. E.g. send a “are you available to talk tonight at 7pm?” message over SMS or other before we call each other.

Like you, I’d love it if there was a way to know the reason of a call before taking it. E.g. “let’s catchup” VS “emergency”. If you find out about a way to do that, please let us know!

Have a great day!
