The chance of receiving a **good surprise or opportunity** is a tremendous incentive to keep our eyes on our inboxes and notifications.

This happened several times to me, in the past few days, and it convinced me that **hard work always pays**, in the end! 💪

### 1\. Openwhyd users donated 4 months of uptime!

About 2 months ago, I was telling one of my best friends that [Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org/) would be the first project that **I should let go**, if I wanted to rationalise the use of my time across my numerous projects.

A few weeks later, bad news: I’m told that the Whyd company is not gonna pay for its hosting any longer…

For some reason, I could not help but spend even more time migrating Openwhyd to a cheaper server, calling out some friends and users individually to star our Github repo and [donate to cover the costs](https://opencollective.com/openwhyd).

And, you know what? **We succeeded brilliantly!** 🍾

We gathered enough donation money to cover 4 months of hosting fees, and the direct and honest email that we sent to our 110k users resulted in some of them offering to help with their time and skills! 🙏

This kind of success story encourages me to keep investing time on this project, and makes me hope of **a bright future for Openwhyd**.

### 2\. A rad demo video + a landing page for teachers

As you may know, my main focus has been to make a commercial product out of the **student evaluation software** I developed for teachers like myself. I’ve already contacted 50 teachers, out of my objective of 100. 🕵

I had already shared [several videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmzn1C-VN6G7DsJb9wn29Pv2XkrF8aI6Q) explaining the details of writing auto-graded exercises for exams and continuous evaluation. But this time, I was kindly advised by Maxime, the creator of the awesome Youtube channel about French rap: “[Le Règlement](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcqe1EHmdaLVBwfqk5OtmXw)”. So the **quality has improved**! 💯

Also, I published a **landing page** that will hopefully help me gather email addresses of teachers who would be interested to test my product: [Corriger le code de vos étudiants en 1 minute](https://adrienjoly.com/eval/). ([adrienjoly.com/eval](https://adrienjoly.com/eval/))

French readers, **I value your tips** to improve my landing page and videos!

### 3\. Dev Evangelism? ⛪️

Last but not least, my friend Jérémie sent me an intriguing but **unsuspectedly relevant job offer**: a “Developer Evangelist” position!

I had never though of applying to that kind of jobs. But Jérémie saw that I enjoyed experimenting around technology and sharing content online, so he figured that this kind of job would actually be a **great use of my skills and interests**! 🎯

So, these days I’m reaching out to some of my friends who are (or were) dev evangelists, to learn about the duties and responsibilities of that title. Who knows, **maybe that’s my destiny?** 😎
