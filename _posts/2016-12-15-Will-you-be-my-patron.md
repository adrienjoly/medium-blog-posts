Almost two months ago, I published a crazy idea: [asking for monthly donations to help me keep crafting free software](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/getting-paid-directly-by-users-to-craft-software-for-them-1a8ef5e1a73#.80cqcf746).

After many discussions with friends and other developers, I found the energy to **take a leap of faith and actually do it**!

### The opportunity: Next Step for¬†Trello

Almost three months ago, I crafted a small tool to help me plan my time more efficiently: [Next Step for Trello](https://medium.com/pitchcard/from-95-ideas-to-1-winning-product-a84ddd54df49?source=user_profile---------5---------) (*also read* [*how it fits into my productivity workflow*](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/work-on-12-projects-without-burning-out-f5bec50dafdb#.xi18tiphn)).

Then I realised that other people were interested too: my Chrome Extension got hunted on ProductHunt, and reached 3500+ users in a month, without much effort! I started receiving reviews and messages from very excited users: some of them were happy and grateful, others were frustrated about missing features.

After having spent hours fixing bugs and other critical problems, I figured that this excitement phase was the opportunity to **ask users for support**.

The first thing I had to do was to figure out what my users wanted.

### Listening to users‚Äô wishes¬†üåü

So I launched a survey, and announced it inside my Trello Extension, so that my users could know about it, and tell me what they want:

<figcaption>A Google Form to figure out what my users&nbsp;want</figcaption>

I closed the survey after 95 users had responded, because it was enough to let three top improvement requests emerge:

1.  Make tasks load and refresh faster
2.  Make it remember my favorite display mode
3.  Make it also work from the [trello.com/my/cards](http://trello.com/my/cards) page

<figcaption><em>Top-3 features scored 26.3%, 25.3% and 9.5%, respectively.</em></figcaption>

And, because implementing those improvements would take me a lot of time, I also asked how much they would be OK to donate for that:

<figcaption><em>About 45% of the 95 responders said they would be happy to donate for improving Next Step for&nbsp;Trello</em></figcaption>

I was happy to see that the most generous donators were asking for the same top-3 features!

### Ask users to commit by donating¬†üöÄ

At that point, I figured that I could group these top-3 features into a new version of Next Step for Trello, and launch a crowdfunding campaign towards the development of that version. (*e.g. like* [*Fontawesome did awesomely*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-5))

So I launched two crowdfunding campaigns:

*   a **Kickstarter campaign**: [Next Step for Trello v2.0](http://adrienjoly.us12.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=c1cfafd58fc9699f6d5a661e2&id=e7e6a3610f&e=3ccc5fe84e)
*   and a **Patreon page**: [Adrien Joly is creating Next Step for Trello](https://www.patreon.com/adrienjoly)

I‚Äôve been pushing the former to the users of Next Step for Trello, as it‚Äôs a more clear and direct way for users to give a **one-shot donation**, to support the development of a well-defined set of improvements.

I started the latter on Patreon in order to support a longer-term vision of a process that I‚Äôm starting to follow with Next Step for Tello, as I‚Äôm going to explain in the next section. It‚Äôs also a good way to **reassure users** who want to make sure that Next Step for Trello will keep working in the longer-term.

### What‚Äôs for patrons?¬†üíç

The process I followed with Next Step for Trello is a perfect example of the **collaborative process** that I would like to keep doing exclusively with my patrons:

1.  Gather **ideas** and votes on software I should craft next;
2.  Provide **early beta access**, for testing and feedback;
3.  Improve the software and define a **roadmap**, based on feedback;
4.  Host live coding sessions on Twitch, to **show my work**;
5.  And keep my software **free** to use for everyone.

Plus, as stated on my Patreon page, I‚Äôm happy to make a **custom version** of my software for every of my most generous patrons! And I‚Äôm still open to original reward suggestions!

I know that Patreon campaigns are not usual to support software developers yet, but I would really like to prove that **I don‚Äôt need to craft adult entertainment** to make a living out of my code.

I would be extremely grateful if you believe that **it‚Äôs possible**, and if you support my process by becoming my patron!
