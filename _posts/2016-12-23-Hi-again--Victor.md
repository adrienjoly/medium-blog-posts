Hi again, Victor!

Just in case you or your readers are interested, I made an extension for Trello that displays your ToDos (from your cards’ checklists) directly on Trello’s board view. I called it Next Step for Trello: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/next-step-for-trello](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/next-step-for-trello)

I’d be honoured to read if it’s useful for your workflow!

Cheers,

Adrien
