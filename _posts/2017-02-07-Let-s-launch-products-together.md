### Where am I coming from

    ***<quick-biography>****  
    Started coding at age of 6, got MSc in Computer Science, PhD in Information Retrieval, worked as software developer in a consulting company, in a startup company, then as a freelancer. And been teaching students how to code in JavaScript, while bootstrapping startup ideas on my own.*  
    ***</quick-biography>***

### Let’s put cards on the table

Over the last 2 years, I have accumulated and shared [dozens of ideas](https://www.pitchcard.io/u/adrienjoly) I’d be motivated to work on, and [started to work on a bunch of them](https://github.com/adrienjoly), because they have been **useful to me** at some point.

**Examples of side-projects** that could be turned into cash-making products:

*   [Next Step for Trello](http://adrienjoly.com/chrome-next-step-for-trello/) (productivity plug-in for Trello, 6000+ installs)
*   [Survey response browser](https://www.pitchcard.io/c/HJSQljeMx) (tool to ease reading user interview responses)
*   [Multiplatform streaming music player](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd-electron) (based on Openwhyd)
*   [pdfreader](https://github.com/adrienjoly/npm-pdfreader) (rule-based parsing of PDF files, including tabular data)
*   [js-exam](https://github.com/adrienjoly/js-exam) *(hmm… I have an idea that I could actually try out alone!)*

### Focusing on what I do best

What I need is to **delegate** the work of turning projects into cash, even in the longer term. Trust a solid product manager — *or business developer?* — to do it, and share the resulting income.

Of course, sharing income means that we’d be also sharing risks. Like startup co-founders!

Except we’d **not** be founding a startup. Just crafting and launching products!

**The perfect match** for a product developer like me would be skilled and happy to:

1.  Pick a problem that we both believe in, and are both excited about.
2.  Identify people who have this problem, and are ready to pay for a solution. Learn from them. (i.e. user interviews)
3.  Discuss business hypotheses (cf. Lean Startup) and metrics to track, to help us take product decisions. (i.e. what feature to add / to remove)
4.  Define monetisation and communication strategies, then execute them, and share results.
5.  Help on user support tasks. (i.e. we’d reply to happy and angry users)
6.  And, possibly represent our product towards press, and social events.

…while I’d be doing the coding, debugging, and product improvements!

### \=> Next Step: collaborate

This article is not a call for collaborators. I’m lucky enough for having found wonderful collaborators on two projects.
